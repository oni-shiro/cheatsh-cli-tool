# cheatsh-cli-tool


A comprehensive wrapper around [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh/) to be used.
Update the array to have any other languages and libraries. Right now it only suppports language specific urls, in future I will add the support for core-utils.

### to buid it:
```
$ go mod tidy
$ go build
$ ./cheatsh-cli-tool
```
you can add it to any path that is present in path variable to run the executable from any other location
